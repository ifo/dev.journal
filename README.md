# dev.journal

dev.journal is currently a small script that will setup a journal markdown file
for the day. The format is always `./<date>/<date>.md`.

It will copy any previous days entry that's been written in the past 7 days and
uses the same format as above.

Configuration will be coming soon! And things may change at any time.

## TODO

- Add configuration
  - Possibly a .journal or journal.[json|toml|...] file?
- Determine decent topic defaults (better that "General" and "Learn")
